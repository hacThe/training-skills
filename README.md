# Training Skill Set Repository

Welcome to my training skill set repository! This repository is where I store my code and projects as I continue to develop my skills in various areas. Each skill has its own branch, and I work on it until I feel confident in my abilities.

## Skills

Here's a list of the skills I'm currently working on, along with their current status, title, and time spent:

| Skill | Status | Title | Time start |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| Skill 1 | Inprogress | Fullstack Web App initialization with Docker | 29/04/2023 |

I will continue to update this table as I work on new skills and make progress on existing ones.

## Branches

Each branch in this repository corresponds to a specific skill. For example, the `skill-1` branch is where I am currently working on Skill 1. When I complete a skill, I merge its branch into the `main` branch.

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to check out my training skill set repository. I hope you find it useful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
