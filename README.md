# Fullstack Web App Initialization with Docker

This project provides a boilerplate setup for a fullstack web application using Docker containers. It includes a backend API built with Node.js and a frontend client built with React. Both the backend and frontend are containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Requirements

- Docker version 20.10.5 or higher
- Docker Compose version 1.29.1 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hacThe/training-skills.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd training-skills`
3. Check out to fullstack-web-app-initialization-with-docker branch: `git checkout fullstack-web-app-initialization-with-docker`
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the containers.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend client.

## Usage

Once you have the containers up and running, you can start modifying the code to build your own fullstack web application. The `backend` and `frontend` directories contain the source code for the backend API and frontend client, respectively. You can edit these files to build your own custom web application.
